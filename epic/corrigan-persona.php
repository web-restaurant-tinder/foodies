	<p>As a monthly user of Restaurant Tinder, Jeremy wants to be able to quickly and easily find somewhere to eat that he and friends will enjoy.</p>

<h3>Use Case</h3>
	<p>It is 7pm. Jeremy and his friend has listed dozens of possible places to go out to eat together and they have yet to come to an agreement. Jeremy remembers Restaurant Tinder. He then grabs his iPhone 10X and goes to the Restaurant Tinder app using the Safari browser.
	He logs in and so does his friend. They begin swiping left or right to indicate a restaurant they like or do not like. After a few minutes of both of them swiping they realize they have matched on a number of restaurants. They finally pick a new restaurant to try out that they
	both like.</p>

<h3>Interaction Flow</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Jeremy pulls out his iPhone 10X which is using the latest iOS software update and navigates to the Safari browser. He then types in the Restaurant Tinder web address in the search bar.</li>
		<li>The browser then opens up a set of results for the search.</li>
		<li>Jeremy will then click the Restaurant Tinder link, which will bring him to the homepage of Restaurant Tinder.</li>
